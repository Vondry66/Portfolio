    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I much prefer nonSQL database over the SQL ones, but I am more than happy to work with SQL ones too ! I slightly favor the front end side of programming. 
        I have experience with kanbans like Trello. I am used to wireframes

      My hobbies include cars - mainly JDM. Video games, listening to metalcore, and to unwind, I enjoy creating DnD campaigns for my friends.
